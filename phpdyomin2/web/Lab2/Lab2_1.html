    <p> Beginning a game in The Second Age requires very few materials. Besides at least one copy of this rulebook, players will need pencils or pens and copies of their character sheets to record information about their characters. The group will also need access to one or more standard 10-sided dice. Two dice per player is recommended.
    <p> <button class="fontchange"> Нажми на меня </button>
    <p> Everyone involved in the game should also use the special, custom dice first created by Fantasy Flight Games for their Genesys roleplaying game. These dice were designed specifically to manage the unique system of resolution used in this game. The dice are described in detail later in this chapter.
